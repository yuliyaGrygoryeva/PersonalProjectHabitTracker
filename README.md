## Background

There are a lot of task tracking applications from simple to-do lists to big daily habit trackers. But I would like to create a habit tracker based on my experience.  For better motivation I added NFC tags support to track habits and daily tasks. For example, if a user has a goal to practice their guitar daily, they can place a NFC tag on or near their guitar and when they are ready to practice, they can check in via placing their phone next to the tag and responding to the notification.


## MVP

- As a user, I want to be able to create a list of habits and daily tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to setup options to repeat habits or tasks one time or daily.
- As a user, I want to set up reminders for each task or habit.
- As a user, I want to track progress on habits.
- As a user, I want to see my list of tasks and habits every day automatically generated.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark habits and daily tasks as done, so they will disappear from the list for today.
- As a user, I want to be able to connect my habits and tasks with NFC tags.
- As a user, I want to be able to confirm that task or habit is done using NFC tag.
- As a user, I want to easily track habits by automatically checking off a daily goal when I come into close proximity of the object that is connected to my habit.
